### Drag-and-Drop UI for Microsoft Academic Queries in Lively4 

- Problem
  -Having a query language for Microsoft Academic is powerful
  -But textual query language can be tedius:
  -Typing *(or copy and pasiting) with entity identifiers
  -Textual syntax like “And()” , “Composite()” and using sometimes quotes and sometimes not 
-Opportunity
  -Use a graphical block-based language allows to display author names insteadof identifiers
  -Drag and drop fits into explorative UX
-Impact
  -Query based navigation becomes more explorative
  -Queries become readable and part of the UI
