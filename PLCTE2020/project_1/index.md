# Project 1: Leonard Pabst <br> Drag-and-Drop UI for Microsoft Academic Queries

[**google slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VMR78FqUW64xH4XG3bpXGq_s-vvx41TFfIG1GAx2WIk/edit#slide=id.p)

- Problem
  - Having a query language for Microsoft Academic is powerful
  - But textual query language can be tedious:
  - Typing *(or copy and pasting) with entity identifiers
  - Textual syntax like “And()” , “Composite()” and using sometimes quotes and sometimes not 
- Opportunity
  - Use a graphical block-based language allows to display author names instead of identifiers
  - Drag and drop fits into explorative UX
- Impact
  - Query based navigation becomes more explorative
  - Queries become readable and part of the UI

- Programming Tasks (to begin with)
  - Parse Microsoft Academic Queries
  - Create UI for nested Queries
  - Generate textual queries from UI
