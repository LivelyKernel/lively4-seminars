# Project 6: Composability and Reuse in VivideJS

![](screenshot.png)

## Goals:

- Allow to share vivide artifacts at different levels of abstraction:
- Provide a repository of script steps
- Provide profiles to reuse scripts
- Compose and share multiple views as a singular tool
- Handle identity of evolving and branching scripts

## Readings (to start with):

- Marcel Taeumel, Michael Perscheid, Bastian Steinert, Jens Lincke, and Robert Hirschfeld. Interleaving of Modification and Use in Data-driven Tool Development. Onward! 2014 (pdf)
- Jens Lincke, Robert Krahn, Dan Ingalls, Marko Röder, and Robert Hirschfeld. The Lively PartsBin – A Cloud-based Repository for Collaborative Development of Active Web Content. HICSS 2012. (pdf)


## Problems
 - No tutorial at all. The readings give a fine overview on how thing work, but not a detailed description oh ow to begin. Big first showstopper is finding a documentation on connecting different parts.
 - Difficulties to add new steps and overall getting started.
 

## Solutions
- Object Inspector
- Halo Search and Recommendations based on Data type
- Scripts and applications should be saved

## Progress at 17.11.2019
Object Inspection works and would have bindings for subselection. Unfortunately currently missing some information to make the changes visually understandable.
