# Marcel Jankrift, Benjamin Feldmann - Lively4 App


## Abstract

The Lively4 App is a native application which runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It bundles the Lively4 Server and Lively4 Client and it is based on the electron framework. Thus, no internet connection is required to work with the application. Nevertheless, the Lively4 git component may be used to synchronize the repositories. Archiving a specific revision state can be achieved by building the installation files with electron.
