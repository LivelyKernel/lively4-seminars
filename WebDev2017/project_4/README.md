## WritePad handwriting recognition

In an era of machine learning, recognizing handwritten text becomes a solveable task. When looking on GitHub, one can find various kinds of implementations of handwritten text or character recognition. Their objective is to provide a native app running on the operating system or detect single symbols with trained neural nets. However, finding an implementation which is open source on the one hand and has a good recognition rate on the other hand. [WritePad](http://www.phatware.com/index.php?q=page/writepad/ipad/de#) by PhatWare fullfills these requirements. Our application integrates the WritePad handwriting library into the lively ecosystem.
