## Live Programming Workshop

*"The LIVEâ€™19 workshop [... is about]  ideas for improving the immediacy, usability, and learnability of programming. Live programming gives the programmer immediate feedback on the behavior of a program as it is edited, replacing the edit-compile-debug cycle with a fluid programming experience. The best-known example of live programming is the spreadsheet, but there are many others."* [Live2019](https://2019.splashcon.org/home/live-2019)
