## Babylonian Programming in IntelliJ 

- @Patrick

## Live Modelling 

- @Patrick

---
## Spatial Arrangement of Software Systems 

- @Tom
- Are there better spatial arrangements for source code than tree structures in file hierarchies? 
- Explore and implement manners to manually curate spatial layouts of large code bases in a block-based programming environment. 

---
## Debugging Blocks

- @Tom
- Block-based programming systems can easily be extended with decorations or secondary UI widgets. 
- Explore and implement visualizations in a block-based system connected to a stepping debugger.

---
## Runtime value visualization

- @Tom
- Systems like Babylonian Programming enable programmers to place probes on expressions to report runtime values. 
- Explore rich, domain-specific visualizations that display and/or accumulate these.
