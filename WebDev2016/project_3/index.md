## Background: 
- Hard to search find private content and code

## Problem: 
- Cannot use public search services for private data

## Idea: 
- Search private data on cloud storages and services – Persist index on private services, cloud storage, or web browser

## Goal: 
- Provide instant code search in lively tools – Provide navigation between #tags in private content
