## Ideas

- Scripting in Markdown, active assay support, e.g. Async Promise Example @jenslincke
- Annotations, ... because yeah we need it @jenslincke
- Material Point Point Method again... fail and stand up... start with debugging support! @onsetsu
- XRay from UI into code....
- annotate code and see affects in ui and behavior.... 
  - simple example: lively.showElement only without touch code...
  - second example: hightlight UI element when editing markdown

### Old Good Demos

- Recreating "Blockheizkraftwerk Simulation", Visualisierung + DSL + Example, Webwerkstatt -> Lively4 @jenslincke

### Programming with Dataflow

- Vivide
- Lively Fabrik
- Composition History of Visualizations in BP2019

### EUD Project Ideas useful for BP2019

- Shadama, sensing and interacting with other turtles directly, e.g. easy hunter pray simulations @jenslincke
- Exploring Visualizations
- Mapping Data/Code to Application / Visualization and back (2 topics)

### Examples and Code

- Babylonian Programming 
  - Async ... 
  - Navigating traces

### Less EUD but ... we need it

- Cherry picking in a Lively Wiki 
  - Wiki history is pure change history... how to make sense through creating sensible commit chunks afterwards
    - Related Work: Thresher?
- EUD layer for higher level version control support like branching and updating stable versions...
    
### Collaboration

- Webstrates and Lively4
- live collaborative editing in one editor
  - Operation Transformations....
- shared whiteboard 

## Annotations

- annotating websites with lively4 chrome extension.... and annotations.js
  - standoff monkey patching of websites
